To generate the go files for the database,
in the root folder for the project run in CMD.exe:
sqlc generate -f server/internal/server/db/config/sqlc.yml

In the sqlc.yml:
    gen:
      go:
        package: "db"
        out: "../"

This generates the .go files to the path specified in the out string.
Also sets those files to use the package "db"

CREATE, DELETE, DROP, INSERT, and UPDATE operations
should only be handled by ONE writer.
