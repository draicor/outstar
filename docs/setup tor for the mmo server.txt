1. Download Tor Expert Bundle, extract to desktop, run tor.exe once, wait for tor to connect and then close the window.
2. Copy the contents of the bundle into the new folder created in app data without the folders, all in the tor folder. [C:\Users\Draicor\AppData\Roaming\tor]
3. Create a torrc file with the following data:
SOCKSPort 9050

EntryNodes {us}
ExitNodes {us} 
StrictNodes 1

HiddenServiceDir "C:/Users/Draicor/AppData/Roaming/tor/hidden_mmo"
HiddenServicePort 31591 127.0.0.1:31591

4. To start the service once, execute the tor.exe file. The tor process window cannot be closed or the connection will be terminated.

5. Check if the process is running by typing in cmd:
netstat -ano | findstr ":9050"
default ip and port are 127.0.0.1:9050

6. Add this to your torrc file to setup entry and exit nodes!
EntryNodes {us},{ve}
ExitNodes {us},{ve} 
StrictNodes 1

7. To install the tor service so it connects to the protocol on start up, use a command prompt as admin and type:

C:\Users\Draicor\AppData\Roaming\tor\tor.exe --service install -f "C:\Users\Draicor\AppData\Roaming\tor\torrc" 
This will install it as a service but fail to start it due to lack of permissions.
Open Services in windows, look for Tor Win32 Service and right click, properties, Log On, log on as: and change it to local system account.

Then type C:\Users\Draicor\AppData\Roaming\tor\tor.exe --service start and it should work okay!

8. Running tor.exe after adding the hidden service under the torrc file will create a folder with a public and private key in it, and a hostname.
