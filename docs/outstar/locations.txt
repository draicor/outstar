PLANETS
The Scourge reacts uniquely on each planet,
 mutating life on Eden, singing on Veyth, lurking in Kharxis’ depths.
These worlds were never meant for us. They were a test, one that we're failing.

-EDEN
Humans have always been bad at irony.
Closest to the system's star (a dim red dwarf),
From orbit, Eden still looks alive.
A swirl of emerald and gold, wrapped in lazy storms.
The sky has a perpetual amber haze. The atmosphere is thick, humid and toxic.
The forests move. Bioluminescent fungi climb over the wreckage of the Ark Fleet,
 their tendrils pulsing like veins.
Their spores glow in your lungs if you breathe them.
Black rain falls, carrying dissolved Scourge particles.
The Capitalists built their station above the poison, Eden's Rib floats above the storms,
 where the air is filtered and the rich control the markets.

-VEYTH
As deadly as it is beautiful, it doesn't care if you live.
Located in the middle, the planet is tidally locked (one side eternal day, the other endless night).
The atmosphere is thin and corrosive. 
The day side is a desert of fused glass, forged by ancient orbital strikes.
Walk too far, and your boots melt to your feet.
The night side is worse—a cathedral of ice where the Evangelists carve their prayers into,
 glaciers of frozen ammonia that weep black tears. 
Between them, in the razor-thin twilight zone,
 lies the only habitable strip,
 littered with ship graveyards repurposed as slums,
 where the last free humans scurry like roaches.
And the wind never stops howling. The Evangelists say it’s God singing.
Everyone else knows it’s just the sound of a planet dying.

-KHARXIS
Farthest from the star, drifting in perpetual twilight.
Kharxis, eats the hopeful. The surface is a global ice sheet covering a subsurface ocean.
The sky has auroras that flicker with Scourge energy, luring the devout to their deaths.
The ice stretches forever, broken only by the jagged metal teeth of mining rigs.
They drill toward the black ocean below, where the water is thick with things that shouldn’t be there.
Sometimes, a drill breaks through, and the liquid that surges up isn’t water.
The Capitalists sell it as "miracle fuel." The Commoners know better—they’ve seen what happens when you touch it.
Machines sent into the ocean return empty, their cameras filled with static.


ASTEROID BELTS
The factions must navigate two nightmares,
 the planets and the monsters in the gaps between.

-ASHEN BELT
Between Eden and Veyth, the Ashen Belt churns—a graveyard of broken ships.
This is no ordinary debris field.
The asteroids here are stitched together with salvaged hulls,
 forming labyrinthine strongholds that drift on erratic orbits.
The Ashen Belt’s real curse? The Scourge left scars here.
Some asteroids hum with dormant energy, and the Reavers dare each other to touch them.
The ones who do either die—or come back changed, their eyes flickering with something not human.
In the Ashen Belt you'll find the Rust Circus, a hollowed-out colony ship turned fight club;
 Black Anchor Station, a pirate haven built inside the carcass of an Ark Fleet dreadnought;
 and The Screaming Maw, a derelict mining rig where Reavers broadcast their raids live.

- FARSEER'S BELT
Between Veyth and Kharxis, the Farseer’s Belt spins slow and heavy,
 its ice-black asteroids veined with strange metals.
This is where the system’s outcasts go to disappear.
The Reavers here are different. Colder. Weirder.
They say the belt whispers to them. They’re not lying.
This belt doesn’t just hide Reavers. It hides what the Scourge didn’t finish.
The Evangelists send pilgrims here to die. The Sages send probes that never return.
And the Reavers? They laugh, patch their ships with scrap, and dive deeper into the dark.
In here You'll find the Hollow Vaults, ancient alien ruins, half-melted, where Reavers trade in relics;
the Driftgrave, a necropolis of wrecked ships, strung with flickering lanterns made from stolen clone vats;
and also, the Last Broadcast Array, a shattered comms hub that still picks up signals—sometimes from dead ships,
 sometimes from something beyond the system.
