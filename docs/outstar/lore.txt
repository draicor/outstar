The Scourge Awakens
Earth was dying. Humanity, starving and desperate, cast its final gamble—the Ark Fleets.
For generations, they drifted through the void toward the Cradle System,
 a flicker of hope boasting three habitable worlds: Eden, Veyth, and Kharxis.
They arrived to ruins.
Something ancient and merciless stirred at their intrusion.
Within days, the Scourge descended—not as a plague, but as a silent executioner.
Ships crumpled like paper. Reactors bled molten fire.
The devout named it divine judgment; the scholars called it what it was: an artificial intelligence,
 buried in the bones of a dead civilization, now measuring humanity’s worth in screams.

The Fractured Survivors
The first years were chaos.
With the Scourge's judgment passed and our fleets in ruins,
 we clawed our way back from extinction—only to turn on each other.
On Eden, the scholars gathered in the shadow of broken ships,
 picking through alien wreckage like vultures.
They call themselves Sages now, convinced the Scourge can be understood, even controlled.
Their labs hum with forbidden experiments, their hands stained with relic dust.
Veyth became a temple of madness.
The Evangelists whisper to the void, convinced the Scourge speaks to them.
They wear its shards in their flesh like jewels, and when their "miracles" melt bystanders,
 they call it divine will.
Kharxis? That's where the rest of us rot.
The Commoners break their backs in the mines and shipyards, too exhausted to care who rules.
Above them, the Capitalists grow fat trading their suffering—air, water, bullets, all priced in blood.
And at the system's edge, the Reavers—rats that thrive in the walls of civilization.
Pirates, anarchists, butchers. Their bases are littered with the mummified corpses of Loyalist enforcers,
 strung up in mockery of justice.
They don't believe in the Scourge, or redemption, or anything at all.
The so-called Loyalists pretend they're different, that they try to stop them,
 but their justice bends for whoever lines their pockets.
You want protection? pay. The only law left is the one that keeps their vaults full.

The Cycle of Ruin
Ships still vanish. Not quietly—not like ghosts.
We find them broken, their hulls peeled open like rotten fruit,
 corridors strewn with corpses frozen in mid-scream. No survivors.
Other times, a relic awakens.
It might gift a Sage new knowledge... or peel the flesh from their bones.
The Evangelists call these "miracles" and "tests." The rest of us know better.
The only reason we're not extinct? The vats. Cloning tech, salvaged from the Ark Fleet's ruined med-bays,
 jury-rigged with scavenged parts, the vats now serve as the beating heart of our dying civilization.
When you die, your memories get dumped into a new body. These memories arrive in fragments,
 dreams of past deaths haunting us between cycles.
You can spot the ones who've died too many times by their hollow eyes.
The Capitalists control the central cloning facilities in high orbit,
 where the air smells like antiseptic and desperation.
The Reavers have their own... solutions.
Their "Black Vats" run on stolen code and scavenged nutrient slurry.
What if the Scourge is in the vats?
The clones are getting... stranger. More receptive to the relics.
Some Evangelists even whisper that the perfect clone will be the Scourge's final vessel.
We all know the truth: we're just meat recycling itself, fighting a war where death stopped mattering.
We keep dying. We keep waking up. But with every rebirth, something feels more hollow.
The Scourge watches. It learns. And when it next judges us, the vats may not save us.
