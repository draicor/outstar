SENTINELS (Loyalists)
Order at any cost.
The last defenders of a crumbling system.
Soldiers and bureaucrats who believe law is the only thing standing between humanity and chaos.
They hunt reavers, protect trade lanes and secretly profit from the corruption they're sworn to fight.

REAVERS (Anarchists)
Burn the system.
Libertarians, smugglers and warlords who see all laws as chains to be broken.
They raid, steal and leave no survivors.

SAGES (Pragmatics)
Knowledge is power.
Researchers, engineers and relic-hunters.
They see the Evangelists as lunatics, Capitalists as vultures and Reavers as idiots. 

EVANGELISTS (Believers)
Only the faithful will ascend.
A doomsday cult that worships relics.
They burn heretics and use unstable holy tech even if it kills them. 

CAPITALISTS (Industrialists)
Everyone has a price.
They own stations, manipulate markets and hire "deniable assets".
To them, war is just business.

COMMONERS (Workers)
The system runs on our backs.
Miners, mechanics and haulers who keep the lights on.
They're exploited by every other faction, some want revolution, most just want a fair day's pay.
