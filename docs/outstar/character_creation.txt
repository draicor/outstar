GENDER: Male or Female

POLITICAL AFFILIATION: Loyalist or Anarchist
-LOYALIST (Sentinels: soldiers, democrats)
Freedom's just chaos with prettier chains.
Someone's got to hold the line. The capitalists sell it, the evangelists pray over it, but we bleed for it.

-ANARCHIST (Reavers: outlaws, pirates)
There is no law in the void, only hunger, only fire.
The universe doesn't care about laws or morals. The strong take, the weak obey. 

FAITH: Pragmatic or Believer
-PRAGMATIC (Sages: engineers, explorers)
The universe is not a temple.
Every relic we crack open gets us one step closer to building a brighter future.

-BELIEVER (Evangelists: fanatics, cultists)
The faithful will inherit the stars, the rest will burn.
They call us mad, but we've heard the hymns in the static, they whisper when the stars align.

PRINCIPLES: Profit or Labor
-PROFIT (Capitalists: industrialists, brokers):
Wealth is the truest measure of worth. 
You believe greed drives progress. Let others mine the ore, you'll own the refinery.

-LABOR (Commoners: workers, miners, haulers):
Value comes from labor, not capital.
Whether mining asteroids or repairing ships, your labor fuels the system, while others profit from it.
